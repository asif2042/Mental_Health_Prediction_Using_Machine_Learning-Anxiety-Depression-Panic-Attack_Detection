# Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning: Anxiety, Depression, and Panic Attack Detection
Overview
This project predicts anxiety, depression, and panic attacks among university students using machine learning. The dataset used is sourced from Dryad (DOI:10.5061/dryad.54qt7), focusing on mental health attributes of French university students. Eight ML models were trained, achieving exceptional performance metrics (98-100%).

Dataset
The dataset includes psychological, behavioral, and demographic features with binary indicators for anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

Methodology
Data preprocessing and feature engineering (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.)
Trained eight ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
